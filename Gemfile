# This gem (https://github.com/github/pages-gem) installs all the gems that are
# used on GitHub Pages locally (and the same versions of these gems). This makes
# the local build environment similar to the build environment on GitHub Pages.
#
# - To install the gems, run "bundle install" (writes Gemfile.lock). This must
#   be only done once, at the very beginning.
# - To synchronise the gem versions installed locally with the versions
#   currently used on GitHub Pages, run "bundle update github-pages"
# - To see the gem versions used locally, run "bundle exec github-pages versions"
# - To see the gem versions currently used by GitHub Pages, go to
#   https://pages.github.com/versions/
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
