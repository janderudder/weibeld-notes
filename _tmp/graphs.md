# Terminology

A graph is a collection of nodes with edges between some of them.

- Directed vs undirected:
- Connected vs. unconnected: there exists a path between any two vertices
- Containing cycles vs. acyclic

# Graph Representation

## Adjacency List

## Adjacency Matrix

# Graph Traversal

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Recursive
- Implementation is simpler than BFS
- Choose, if you want to visit every node of a graph.
- 


## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- Choose if you have to find the shortest path between two nodes
- Not recursive
- Uses a queue
