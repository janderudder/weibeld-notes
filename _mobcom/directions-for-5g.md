Brief overview of the possible directions of a future 5G mobile network, from the point of view of the year 2016.

# Basic design principle

Not just more of the same (e.g. more coverage, capacity, data rate, availability than LTE), but tailored solutions to specific problems/requirements.

For example:

- High-definition TV, other data-centric applications $\longrightarrow$ massive data rates
- Internet of things, M2M $\longrightarrow$ low battery usage
- Self-driving cars, tactile Internet $\longrightarrow$ ultra-short latency, high data rates

# Key dimensions for requirements

- Data rate
- Latency
- Energy consumption and cost
- Number of connected devices

# Design choices

- Wave form (multiple access and signalling) (alternative to OFDM and SC-FDM)
- Modulation (alternative to QAM)

Since 5G approaches different problems with different requirements, there will probably be a palette of technologies (e.g. a range of different wave forms) from which one is selected on a case-by-case basis.

# Possible new technologies

- Millimetre waves (30--300 GHz)
- Massive MIMO
- Densification

# Further new techonologies/directions

- Flat architecture, move logic to network edge, get rid of core network
- Software-defined networking (SDN)
- Network function virtualisation (NFV)
- Cloud radio access network (C-RAN)
- Self-organising network (SON)
- Machine-type communication (MTC)
- Device to device communication (D2D)
- Mobile edge computing (MEC)
- Cognitive radio (CR)
- Energy efficiency
- Full duplex
