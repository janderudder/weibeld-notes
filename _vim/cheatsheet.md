A vim cheatsheet, created by Max Cantor, targeted to be **beautiful** and **organised** (unlike the vim user interface and most other vim cheatsheets).

The project is presented [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxcantor/beautiful-vim-cheat-sheet-poster). It seems to be possible to buy high-resolution electronic and physical copies (posters).
