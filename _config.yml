# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# With Jekyll version 3.7.0 all the collection directories can be gathered in a
# single top-level directory. This directory can be specified in _config.yml
# by "collections_dir: my_collections" (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).
#
# However, this can only be used when GitHub Pages updates to Jekyll v3.7.0.
