This is a non-exhaustive list of libraries and coworking spaces in Bangkok.

The state is from May 2017, so details might have changed in the meantime.

# Libraries

There are many good libraries for studying in Bangkok. Note that most of them are closed on Mondays.

Note that often in Thailand the WiFi is not free and relatively expensive. And at some places you have to pay for using the power outlets, or you're not allowed to use them at all (that's Thailand).

## Thailand Creative and Design Center (TCDC)

- Great place to study, newly opened in 2017. Definitely worth to get the yearly membership. With the yearly membership you can also enter the TCDC library in Chiang Mai.
- In the [Bangkok General Post Office](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%9A+%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%9E+-+TCDC+Bangkok/@13.7268159,100.5151686,19.25z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1stcdc+bangkok!3m4!1s0x30e29f022db566ff:0x287c0f1b5fbe26f3!8m2!3d13.726703!4d100.5155699)
