Explanation of the concepts **work**, **energy** and **power** known from physics.

Work (Arbeit)
=============

- Unit: J (joule), Nm (newton-metre), cal (calorie), Ws (watt-second), kWh (kilowatt-hour)
- "Moving a mass over a distance"
- $W = F \, s$ (work is force times distance)
- Example:
    - Force: $F = 10 \text{N}$
    - Distance: $s = 2 \text{m}$
    - Work: $W = F \, s = 20 \text{Nm} = 20 \text{J}$
- Equivalences: $1 \text{J} = 1 \text{Nm} = 1 \text{Ws}$
- *Analogy with distance (120 km)*


Energy (Energie)
================

- Unit: J (joule), Nm (newton-metre), cal (calorie), Ws (watt-second), kWh (kilowatt-hour)
- "Capacity to do work"
- Equivalent to work


Power (Leistung)
================

- Unit: W (watt), hp (horsepower), dBm (decibel-milliwatt)
- "Amount of work done per time"
- "Rate of doing work"
- "Energy consumed per time"
- "Light bulb wattage: rate at which the light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat"
- $P = \frac{W}{t}$ (power is work divided by time)
- Examples:
    - Doing 500 Nm work in 5 sec.: $P = \frac{500\text{Nm}}{5\text{s}} = 10\text{W}$
    - Doing 500 Nm work in 1 hour: $P = \frac{500\text{Nm}}{3600\text{s}} = 0.134\text{W}$
    - 40 W light bulb: amount of energy used in 1 hour: $E = 40\text{W} \cdot 3600 \text{s} = 144000 \text{J}$
- Equivalences:
    - $W = \frac{\text{J}}{\text{s}}$
    - $1 \text{hp} \approx 740 \text{W}$
- *Analogy with speed (30 km/h)*
